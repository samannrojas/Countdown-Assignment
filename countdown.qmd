# Instructions (read me)

1.  Create a **new RStudio Project** (File → New Project… → New Directory → New Project).

2.  **Save this file** in the project as `countdown.qmd`.

3.  In the next section, **insert a screenshot** of your draw (the six numbers and the target).

4.  In the code chunk under **“Your Solution”**, write an expression that reaches the target **using only the given numbers** once each, with `+ - * /` and parentheses.

5.  Your **last line must start** `answer <-` and evaluate to the **exact target**.

6.  Render (Quarto → Render).

7.  Commit & push to GitHub. Submit the repository link in Blackboard.
